### P

A problem is 'P' if it is solveable and verifiable in polynomial time


### NP

A problem is 'NP' if it is verifiable in polynomial time, given a solution. An NP problem that is also P will be solveable in P time, but the rest will not be

Example. factorization can be verified in polynomial time


### NP-Hard

A problem is 'NP-Hard' if it is at least as difficult as the most difficult NP problem. An 'NP-Hard' problem that is also NP-Complete may be verifiable in P time, but the rest will not be

Example. the travelling salesman 

### NP-Complete

A problem is 'NP-Complete' if it is both NP and NP-Hard

Example. the knapsack problem
