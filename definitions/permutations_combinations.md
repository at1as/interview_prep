### Permutations of n without replacements

```
for n items:

P(n) = n
```

### Permutations of n with replacement:

```
for n items:

P(n) = n!
```

### Permutations of k from n:

```
for n items, and k-length series:

P(n, k) = n!/(n-k)!
```

### Combinations of k from n

```
for n items, and k-length sets (non-ordered):

P(n, k) = n! / k!(n - k)!

Termed as "n 'choose' k problem"
```
